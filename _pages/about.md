About me

Hi, I'm Anne (Heekyung). I'm an 4th year undergraduate student in Computer Science Engeineering at [Pohang University of Technology](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/) (POSTECH, South Korea).


Research
------
I am interested in <b>Computer Vision</b>, <b>LLM Safety</b> and <b>LLM Agent Systems</b>. Specifically, <b>Multi-Modal LLMs</b> (especially Visual Language Models (VLMs)) mitigating hallucinations and on improving their reasoning skills. Recently, I find topics of <b>Image Processing</b> and <b>Computer Graphics</b> interesting.

During my exchange semester (2024 Fall, 2025 Spring), I joined [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu) as an undergraduate researcher, under Prof. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/)'s group.
